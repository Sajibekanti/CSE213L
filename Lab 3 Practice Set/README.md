Write a C Program to find the GCD of two given integers.
Sample Input
Enter First Integer: 12
Enter Second Integer: 8
Sample Output
GCD of 12 and 8 = 4

Hint:
What is GCD?
The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of Two or more than Two Integers is the Largest Integer (which is Positive) that divides the Numbers without a Remainder.
Example of GCD
The LCM of 3 and 2 is 1.
The GCD of 12 and 8 is 4.

Formula to Find GCD of Two Integers
54
The Number 54 can be divided by 1, 54, 2, 18, 27, 6, 9, 3
24
The Number 24 can be divided by 1, 24, 3, 8, 12, 2, 4, 6
Common Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6
The Largest Divisor is 6. Therefore, GCD of Integers 54 and 24 is 6.



Write a C Program to find the LCM of two given integers.
Sample Input
Enter First Integer: 2
Enter Second Integer: 3
Sample Output
GCD of 2 and 3 = 6

Hint:

What is LCM?
A Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Two Integers is the Smallest Number which is a multiple of both the Numbers.
Example of LCM
The LCM of 4 and 3 is 12.
Formula to Find LCM of Two Integers
L.C.M = (x*y)/G.C.D
Write a C program to print the given 1 square number pattern using loop.
